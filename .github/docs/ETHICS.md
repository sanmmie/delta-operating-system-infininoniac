# ∆Ethical Framework

### Core Principle
Technology should serve humanity — not the other way around.  
∆OS is a framework for transformation rooted in ethics, openness, and inclusivity.

### 1. Human-Centered Purpose
Develop systems that amplify human potential, preserve cultural identity, and protect user dignity.

### 2. Transparency & Integrity
Be honest in code, communication, and representation. Document your logic; publish your data responsibly.

### 3. Cultural Preservation
Recognize and protect indigenous knowledge, languages, and spiritual heritage in digital form.

### 4. Sustainability
Favor efficiency, energy-awareness, and longevity over technological novelty.

### 5. Collaborative Stewardship
Every contributor is a co-steward. Share openly, respect others’ domains, and evolve ∆OS through consensus.
