# ADR 001: Coordination Over Control

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Traditional systems often use command-and-control patterns that create conflicts between domains. We need to choose between:
1. Centralized control (traditional OS model)
2. Distributed coordination (emergent harmony model)

## Decision
We choose **Coordination Over Control** as our foundational principle.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Domains maintain autonomy
- Emergent harmony from voluntary cooperation
- More resilient to single points of failure
- Respects platform security boundaries

### Negative
- Requires sophisticated conflict resolution
- No guaranteed compliance from domains
- Complex coordination logic
- Potential for deadlocks or indecision

## Compliance Check
All components must:
- [ ] Use request/response patterns, not commands
- [ ] Provide opt-in mechanisms for domains
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation when coordination fails
- [ ] Respect domain autonomy and boundaries
